# Lets get connected!

Before you can do anything you'll need to [create an account](/).

To chat on Matrix you need a client. We're going to use [Element](https://element.io/download).

It's available for Android, IOS, Desktop and even has a web version you can use right in your browser

Since this is Level Two, we'll pick the web client!

### [Here's a link straight to Element Web](https://app.element.io/#/login)

Once you're there, just Continue
